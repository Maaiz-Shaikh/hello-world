# About Me
I am 2nd-year student who loves and enjoys doing programming in java, solving mathematical problems, and logical reasoning questions. I want to become a Software Developer. I was a school topper in my 10th and 12th Standard. I like to work with sincerity and dedication. I believe in self-learning and try to implement things practically.

During my childhood, I was a curious student (still I am) who was fond of new things specially in technological domain. In High School, I was introduced to programming (python in particular), which impressed me a lot and enforced me to opt for Computer Science and Engineering branch. I am passionate about programming.

I am also interested in the field of Web development and App development. And, in near future, I would love to learn these skills and work on it. Other than that, I am also interested in Communication Skill, Public Speaking Skill and Personality Development.

I am a fitness freak and want to introduce fitness factor in the software developer's field which I think a unique as well as an interesting concept.
